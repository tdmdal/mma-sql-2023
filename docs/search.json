You should already have it installed if you took the online course by Scott Simpson (see Prerequisite above).\nDownload the dataset (northwind.sqlite3).\nLoad the dataset in DB Browser for SQLite, and follow along using the html version of the notebook.\n\n\n\n\nSQL Setup for RSM8411 (MMA, Fall 2023)\nYou will learn more SQL in RSM8411 this fall. Instead of SQLite as we use in this workshop, RSM8411 will use PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source DBMS. Please make sure you have it installed and tested before the end of this workshop. If you encounter any problem setting it up, please let me know.\n\nDownload and install the latest version of PostgreSQL. You can follow the installation guide from this PostgreSQL Tutorial site: Windows installation or MacOS installation. Note that\n\nThe guide is for an earlier version of PostgreSQL, but the procedures are similar for the latest version.\nPostgreSQL management client pgAdmin is included in the installation.\nYou do NOT need to install the component “Stack Builder”.\nAfter the installation, you should verify that everything is installed correctly. Follow the “Verify the Installation” step in the Windows installation guide or the “Load the sample database” step in the MacOS installation guide.\n\nGetting-started resources: PostgreSQL Essential Training. (To access this LinkedIn course for free, refer to information in the Prerequisite section.)\n\n\nBack to TDMDAL Computing Page"
